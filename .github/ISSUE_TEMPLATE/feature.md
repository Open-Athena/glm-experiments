## Feature Description

<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of the feature you want to add -->

## Motivation and Context

<!-- Why is this feature needed? What problem does it solve? -->

## Proposed Solution

<!-- Describe your proposed solution in detail. Include:
- High-level design approach
- Key components that need to be created/modified
- How it integrates with existing code (PyTorch Lightning, Hydra, etc.)
-->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- Break down the implementation into clear, testable steps. For complex features, consider splitting into:
1. Refactoring to enable the feature (if needed)
2. Implementation of the feature itself

Each step should be small enough to go from working code to working code.
